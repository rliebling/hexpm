## Organizations going live

<div class="subtitle">February 1, 2018 · by Eric Meadows-Jönsson</div>

A few months ago we introduced the beta of private packages and organizations. In the meantime we
have been building the billing system and iterating on organizations. We'd like to thank beta
users for their valuable feedback.

Today we are going out of beta and are going [live with organizations](/pricing). Beta users will
have to go to the [organization dashboard](/dashboard) and enter a payment method and billing
details to continue using organizations. You have **40 days** to enter a payment method.

The pricing will be **$8.00 per user / month** + local VAT where applicable. If you are using private
packages for open source please contact [support@hex.pm](mailto:support@hex.pm). Check out the
documentation for more information about [using private packages](/docs/private) and check out
the [FAQ](/docs/faq) for more information about how organizations are billed.
